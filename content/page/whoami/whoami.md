My name is Roberto D'Andrea and I am a cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience in securing cloud environments. I currently work as a Cloud Security Engineer at CoreView, where I manage threat detection and response using Microsoft Sentinel and Defender XDR.
I actively contribute to the continuous improvement of the CoreView platform’s security. I identify potential vulnerabilities, implement enhanced security controls, and participate in the development of new features focused on strengthening the platform’s resilience against evolving cyber threats.
I help companies keep their data safe and protected from cyber threats. My daily work involves finding security risks and stopping attacks before they happen, making sure that cloud systems run smoothly and securely.
