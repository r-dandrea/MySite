Hi, I’m Roberto D’Andrea, a passionate cybersecurity professional with hands-on expertise in securing cloud environments. Currently, I’m a Cloud Security Engineer at CoreView, where I dive deep into threat detection and incident response using powerful tools like Microsoft Sentinel and Defender XDR. Beyond just managing threats, I’m actively involved in shaping and enhancing CoreView’s platform security — hunting down vulnerabilities, rolling out robust defenses, and brainstorming new features to make our platform smarter and tougher against today’s evolving cyber risks.
I’m dedicated to helping companies keep their valuable data safe and sound. Every day, I work to spot the hidden risks, stop cyber attacks before they happen, and ensure the cloud systems run seamlessly and securely. My goal is simple: protect what matters most so businesses can thrive without worrying about security. If you want someone who’s both tech-savvy and committed to making cybersecurity proactive and approachable, that’s me!
